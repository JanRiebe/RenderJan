This is a little learning project of mine.

I'm trying to write a raytracing global illumination renderer, to learn the basic inner workings of renderers and experiement with different approaches.


I'm mainly following this awsome resource: https://www.scratchapixel.com/
And also this inspireing lecture series from the TU Wien: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLujxSBD-JXgnGmsn7gEyN28P1DnRZG7qi
